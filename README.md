# Telegram bot for azure queue monitoring
## Simple bot for azure queues monitoring.
This app was created to help me dealing with my work everyday routine - azure queue checking.
The way it works:

- If there are new messages in this queue, bot will send a notification to the user.
- User can view the most recent messages in any queue he added
